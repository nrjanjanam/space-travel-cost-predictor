## Context

Space Y that would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Billionaire industrialist Allon Musk. I have gathered information about Space X using SpaceX REST API, performed EDA and created dashboards on it. This project has 2 main objectives - 
1. Determine the price of each launch.  
2. Determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. 
Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, I have trained a machine learning model and used public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
